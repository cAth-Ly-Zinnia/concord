# Concord Application
A Mock Discord application focusing on Software Design for my CSC 360 Software Design taught by Professor Bradshaw at Centre College.
## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for my Discord-like application called Concord. A blog application that allows users to create their own 'server' and create text channels based on what interests them!

## Project Detail

This project utilizes Java, Maven, MVC, XML, and JavaFX. Core methodologies that were used were Test Driven Development and collaborative programming. Within this project, my group and I were assigned to create a chatting application and utilize Software Designs based on what we learned in class. Within this final project, we had to work independently from our group and utilize a software design that improves the functionality of the application or the user. The software designs that we implemented were: Builder, Observer, Factory Pattern, and Server/Proxy/Client Architecture.

## Challenges

A challenge that stuck out to me was implementing Java libraries and matching proper syntax. When utilizing Java's XML library and allowing for the application to save directly into a file, ensuring that the code is the SAME syntax in Eclipse is crucial. Even when there were no incorrect details there can be issue with how the code was structured that causes things to be easily corrupt. This easily became a recurring thing that started to impact the progress of the project and I realized that Java can not be forgiving at times.

## What did I learn

I learned that creating proper software designs for applications allows for room for optimization. This project enforced the distinction between being a developer and being an engineer. Engineers are constantly thinking of ways of optimizing and maintaining scalable code.
